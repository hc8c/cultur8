  <h1>Cultur8: sites about TV, film and book analysis</h1>
    <h2>Why a webring?</h2>
    <p>Simply put, because it's getting harder and harder to discover original, human-created content online. Search engine services, and their AI derivatives, are geared around providing answers to simple or specific questions. Rather than pools of diverse, organic and free-flowing content, the web is now dominated by content that's been written FOR search engines, or to serve advertising, or grab user data. What about the deep-dive, niche, fascinating and occasionally utterly random content you used to be able to just stumble across? That's (hopefully) what this web collection will be about.</p>
    <p><bold>Credits:</bold>I'm relying on <a hred="https://garlic.garden/onionring/">onionring</a> to get this going. Thank you to the original creators!</p>
    <h2>Who should join?</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Sites should be written in English.</li>
    <li>Like it says on the tin, sites should offer original commentaries, analysis or theories of film, TV or books. It can be any or all of those.</li>
    <li>Content shouldn't predominantly or only offer reviews.</li>
    <li>Content should be written <bold>by humans</bold>: no AI generated or suggested articles.</li>
</ul>
