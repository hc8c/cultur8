        <h2>Why join or use this web chain (web ring)?</h2>
        <p>
          Simply put, because it's getting harder and harder to discover
          original, human-created content online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search engine services, and their AI derivatives, are largely geared
          to providing one-stop answers to simple or specific questions, and
          less so about browsing, "surfing," or stumbling across interesting
          content within a particular niche.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, rather than pools of diverse, organic and free-flowing
          content, the web is now dominated by content that's been written to
          rank highly in search engines, to serve advertising, or to grab user
          data. Sure, it's much easier to get fast answers to trivia, or find
          practical how-to guides, but much harder to find rabbit holes of
          fascinating content, never mind disappear into them. Hopefully, that's
          what this web ring will offer.

        <h2>Who should join?</h2>
        <p>
          The intention is to curate and link independent sites that aren't
          already served by SEO, ad networks, large funding, etc. There's no
          cost to join the chain; the only requirements are detailed below.
        </p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Blogs, websites, self-hosted or on community pages: all are welcome.
            They may be written by a single person or several, but the site's
            overall ownership should be individuals or collectives, not
            companies. This applies to the editorial outlook, too. This isn't
            the place for advertising or product placement masquering as a blog.
          </li>
          <li>
            For now, content should be in English. This is simply to make it
            easier to review sites before they're added to this web chain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sites should offer original commentary, analysis or theories of
            film, TV or books. It can be any or all of those art forms, but
            should include at least one as a named category on your site.
          </li>
          <li>
            The site's webmaster, whether that's the owner, a writer, developer
            etc, must have the ability to add a html snippet to the site's
            footer, as this is how the web chain's navigation will work. Adding
            the widget to your site, and ensuring it stays in place, is a
            necessary part of chain membership.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Not currently accepting:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sites that <strong>predominantly or only</strong> offer reviews
            rather than detailed analysis. (Nothing against these, just that
            these are already easier to discover.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Absolutely no AI generated, structured or suggested articles. The
            sites in this chain should reflect the beauty of
            <strong>human thought and endeavour</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content mustn't be locked behind paywalls, restrictive cookie
            notices, or notices that force users to turn off adblockers.
          </li>
        </ul>
