        <h2>Why join or use a web chain (web ring)?</h2>
        <p>
          Simply put, because it's getting harder to discover
          original, human-created content online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search engines, and their AI derivatives, are largely geared
          to providing one-stop answers to simple or specific questions, and
          less so about browsing, "surfing," or stumbling across interesting
          content within a particular niche.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, rather than pools of diverse, organic and free-flowing
          content, the web is now dominated by content that's been written to
          rank highly in search engines, to serve advertising, or to grab user
          data. Sure, it's much easier to get fast answers to trivia, or find
          practical how-to guides, but much harder to find rabbit holes of
          fascinating content, never mind disappear into them. Hopefully, that's
          what this web ring will offer.
        </p>

        <h2>Who should join?</h2>
        <p>
          The intention is to curate and link independent sites that aren't
          already served by SEO, ad networks, corporate funding, etc. There's no
          cost to join the chain; the only requirements are detailed below.
        </p>
        <h3>Sites and content</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Blogs, websites, self-hosted, or on community pages, coded from scratch or templates all the way: <strong>all are welcome</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            Sites may be authored by a single person or several, but the site's ownership, management and editorial direction should be directed by individuals or collectives, not
            companies or agencies. This isn't
            the place for ad-heavy projects or product placement masquering as a blog.
          </li>
          <li>
            For now, content should be in English. This is simply to make it
            easier to review sites before they're added to this web chain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sites should offer original commentary, analysis or theories of
            film, TV or books. It can be any or all of those art forms, but
            should include at least one type as a named category on your site.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Webmasters</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The site's webmaster, whether that's the owner, a writer, developer
            etc, must be able to add a html snippet to the site's
            footer, as this is how visitors will travel between sites in the chain.
          </li>
          <li>As the site grows, webmasters will collectively decide new members (i.e., by vote).</li>
<li>Adding
  the widget to your site, and keeping it and your site active, are
  necessary for continued membership of the chain.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Not currently accepting:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sites that <strong>predominantly or only</strong> offer reviews
            rather than detailed analysis. (Nothing against these, just that
            there already are ways to discover this kind of content.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Absolutely no AI generated, structured or suggested articles. The
            sites in this chain should reflect the possibilities of
            <strong>human thought and endeavour</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content mustn't be locked behind paywalls, restrictive cookie
            notices, or anti-adblock tech. If you already have these, you probably don't need a web chain.
          </li>
        </ul>
