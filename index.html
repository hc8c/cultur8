        <h2>Preserving the human web</h2>
        <p>
          Simply put, it's getting harder to discover original, human-created
          content online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search engines, and their AI derivatives, are largely geared to
          providing one-stop answers, and less about stumbling across
          interesting content within a particular niche.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's where web rings come in. Content creators can use them to
          connect with similar sites and, hopefully, find new visitors. Visitors
          can use them to fall into rabbit holes of human-created content they
          might not otherwise found.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >In a nutshell, this web ring is a collection of links to cool
            content humans have written and published online, and which is at
            risk of vanishing from view.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          Sites that are part of a web chain (a.k.a web ring) display a shared
          navigation bar. Visitors can use the "next", "prev" and "random"
          buttons to visit other sites in the chain. That's all there is to it!
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            This project is based on the
            <a href="https://garlic.garden/onionring/" target="_blank"
              >onionring</a

        <h2>Who should join?</h2>
        <p>
          The intention is to curate and link independent sites (passion
          projects!) that aren't already served by SEO, ad networks, corporate
          funding, etc.
          <strong>There's no cost to join the chain</strong>; the only
          requirements are detailed below.
        </p>
        <h3>Sites and content</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This web chain is for sites that produce
            <strong>written content</strong>. How you host or style that content
            is up to you. Blogs, websites, self-hosted, or on community pages,
            coded from scratch or from templates: all are welcome.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sites should offer
            <strong
              >original commentary, analysis or theories of film, TV or
              books</strong
            >
            (<em>not just reviews or news</em>). It can be any or all of those
            art forms, but
            <strong
              >should include at least one as a named category on your
              site</strong
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            For now, content should be in English, to make it easier to review
            sites that want to be added.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Webmasters</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The site's webmaster, whether that's the owner, a writer, developer
            etc, must be able to add a html snippet to their site, as this is
            how visitors will travel around the chain. You'll also need a Github
            account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding the widget to your site, and keeping it and your site active,
            are necessary for continued membership of the chain.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>No AI generated, structured or suggested articles.</li>
          <li>
            Content shouldn't be locked behind paywalls, restrictive cookie
            notices, or anti-adblock tech.
          </li>
          <li>
            No homophobia, transphobia, racism, or other kinds of hate speech.
          </li>
          <li>
            Like it says above, this web ring is for curiosity-filled indie
            sites, rather than blogs built to support products, companies or
            film / book releases, or to serve advertising.

        <h2>How to add your site</h2>
        <p>
          If you've read the instructions and rules above and think your site is
          a good fit, here's what to do next.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">

              Here's a great walkthrough of the submission process</a

            by Call for Code.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>1. Add the widget</h3>
        <p>
          Add the html snippet below to your site. The widget should appear on
          every page of the site, so ideally pop it somewhere like the footer or
          a sidebar.
        </p>
        <div class="widget-example">
          <div class="widget-example-header">
            <span>HTML</span
            ><span
              class="widget-example-copy"
              data-target-id="code-example"
              id="copy-button"
              >Copy &#128203;</span
            >
          </div>
          <pre
            class="widget-example-code"
          ><code id="code-example">&#60;div id="FliteratiWebChain"&#62;
  &#60;script type="text/javascript" 
    src="https://hc8c.github.io/fliterati/onionring-variables.js"&#62;
  &#60;/script&#62;
  &#60;script type="text/javascript" 
    src="https://hc8c.github.io/fliterati/onionring-widget.js"&#62;
  &#60;/script&#62;
&#60;/div&#62;</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          When you first add the code, it will appear on your site like this:
        </p>
        <div class="widget-example before">
          <p>
            About the
            <a href="javascript:void(0)">Fliterati web chain</a>
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Once your site is added to the chain, the widget will appear like so:
        </p>
        <div class="widget-example after">
          <div id="fliteratiWidget">
            <a href="javascript:void(0)">← prev</a> |
            <a href="javascript:void(0)">Fliterati web chain</a>
            | <a href="javascript:void(0)">random</a> |
            <a href="javascript:void(0)">next →</a>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          You're free to style the widget to suit your site, using css, or
          however you normally style your content.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Add your site to the directory</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Once you've added the code, head over to the
            <a href="https://github.com/hc8c/fliterati"
              >Fliterati repo on Github</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on the file called sitelist.js and look for the pencil icon.
            Click it to edit the file.
          </li>
          <li>
            You'll be prompted to fork the repo (basically, to copy it to your
            Github account).
          </li>
          <li>
            Edit <strong>sitelist.js</strong> to add your site details to the
            bottom of the file in the format below. Remember to leave variable
            names like "siteName", and commas, as they are - just update the
            details for your site after each colon.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="widget-example">
          <div class="widget-example-header">

          <li>
            If you've followed the instructions above and your site is a good
            match, I'll add your site to the chain and the directory (hopefully
            within a couple of days to a week).

        <h2>Leaving the chain</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can leave the chain at any time. Just remove the widget from
            your site and then delete your site details from sitelist.js (i.e.,
            the reverse of the above).
          </li>
          <li>
            I'll also review the list occasionally to remove sites that don't
            have the widget or no longer fit the niche.
