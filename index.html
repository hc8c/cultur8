        <h2>Prerving the human web</h2>
        <p>
          Simply put, it's getting harder to discover
          original, human-created content online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search engines, and their AI derivatives, are largely geared
          to providing one-stop answers to simple or specific questions, and
          less so about browsing, "surfing," or stumbling across interesting
          content within a particular niche.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, rather than pools of diverse, organic and free-flowing
          content, the web is now dominated by content that's been written to
          rank highly in search engines, serve advertising, sell you stuff, or grab your personal
          data. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, it's much easier to get fast answers to trivia, or find
          practical how-to guides, but much harder to find rabbit holes of
          fascinating content, never mind disappear into them. Hopefully, that's
          what this web chain will offer. Essentially, <strong>it's a collection of links to cool content humans have written and published online, and which are at risk of vanishing from view.</strong>
        </p>
        <div id="credit">
          <p>
            I've used
            <a href="https://garlic.garden/onionring/" target="_blank"
              >onionring</a
            >
            to get this started, with thanks to the original creators.

        <h2>Who should join this web chain?</h2>
        <p>
          The intention is to curate and link independent sites that aren't
          already served by SEO, ad networks, corporate funding, etc. There's no
          cost to join the chain; the only requirements are detailed below.
        </p>
        <h3>Sites and content</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This web chain is for sites that publish written content. Blogs, websites, self-hosted, or on community pages, coded from scratch or from templates: <strong>all are welcome</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            Content may be authored by a single person or several, but the site should be owned and operated by individuals or collectives, not
            companies or agencies. This isn't
            the place for ad-heavy projects or product placement masquering as a blog.
          </li>
          <li>
            For now, content should be in English. This is simply to make it
            easier to review sites before they're added to this web chain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sites should offer original commentary, analysis or theories of
            film, TV or books. It can be any or all of those art forms, but
            should include at least one as a named category on your site.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Webmasters</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The site's webmaster, whether that's the owner, a writer, developer
            etc, must be able to add a html snippet to the site's
            footer, as this is how visitors will travel between sites in the chain.
          </li>
          <li>As the site grows, webmasters will collectively vote on new members.</li>
<li>Adding
  the widget to your site, and keeping it and your site active, are
  necessary for continued membership of the chain.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Not currently accepting</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sites that <strong>predominantly or only</strong> offer reviews or news
            rather than detailed analysis. (Nothing against these, just that
            there already are ways to discover this kind of content.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Sites that use AI generated, structured or suggested content. The
            sites in this chain should reflect the possibilities of
            <strong>human thought and endeavour</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content mustn't be locked behind paywalls, restrictive cookie
            notices, or anti-adblock tech.
          </li>
        </ul>
