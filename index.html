        <h2>Why make this content chain (web ring)?</h2>
        <p>
          Simply put, because it's getting harder and harder to discover
          original, human-created content online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search engine services, and their AI derivatives, are largely geared
          around providing one-stop answers to simple or specific questions, and
          less so about browsing, "surfing," or stumbling across interesting
          content within a particular niche.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, rather than pools of diverse, organic and free-flowing
          content, the web is now dominated by content that's been written to
          rank highly in search engines, to serve advertising, or to grab user
          data. Sure, it's much easier to get fast answers to trivia, or find
          practical how-to guides, but much harder to find rabbit holes of
          fascinating content, never mind disappear into them. Hopefully, that's
          what this web ring will offer.

        <h2>Which sites are invited to join?</h2>
        <p>
          Here's the current criteria for sites. The intention is to curate
          sites that aren't already served by SEO, ad networks, etc.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li></li>
          <li>
            For now, sites should be written in English. This makes it easier to
            review content before it's added to the creator chain (it may change
            later on).
          </li>
          <li>
            Sites should offer original commentary, analysis or theories of
            film, TV or books. It can be any or all of those art forms, but
            should include at least one as a named category on your site.
          </li>
          <li>Content shouldn't predominantly or only offer reviews.</li>
          <li>
            Content should be written <strong>by humans</strong>: no AI
            generated, structured or suggested articles. The sites on this list
            should reflect the wonders of <strong>human thought</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            This isn't the place for sites that are locked behind paywalls,
            restrictive cookie notices, or that force users to turn off
            adblockers.
          </li>
        </ul>
