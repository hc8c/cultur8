        <h2>Prerving the human web</h2>
        <p>
          Simply put, it's getting harder to discover
          original, human-created content online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search engines, and their AI derivatives, are largely geared
          to providing one-stop answers to simple or specific questions, and
          less so about browsing, "surfing," or stumbling across interesting
          content within a particular niche.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, rather than pools of diverse, organic and free-flowing
          content, the web is now dominated by content that's been written to
          rank highly in search engines, serve advertising, sell you stuff, or grab your personal
          data. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, it's much easier to get fast answers to trivia, or find
          practical how-to guides, but much harder to find rabbit holes of
          fascinating content, never mind disappear into them. Hopefully, that's
          what this web chain will offer. Essentially, <strong>it's a collection of links to cool content humans have written and published online, and which are at risk of vanishing from view.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <h3>How does a web chain work?</h3>
          <p>Sites that are part of a particular web chain display a small nav bar. Visitors can use the "next", "prev" and "random" buttons to visit other sites in the chain. It's beautifully simple.</p>
          <div id="credit">
            <p>
              I've used
              <a href="https://garlic.garden/onionring/" target="_blank"
                >onionring</a
              >
              to get this started, with thanks to the original creators.

        <h2>Who should join this web chain?</h2>
        <p>
          The intention is to curate and link independent sites that aren't
          already served by SEO, ad networks, corporate funding, etc. There's no
          cost to join the chain; the only requirements are detailed below.
        </p>
        <h3>Sites and content</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This web chain is for sites that produce written content. How you host or style that content is up to you. Blogs, websites, self-hosted, or on community pages, coded from scratch or from templates: <strong>all are welcome</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            Content may be authored by a single person or several, but the site should be owned and operated by individuals or collectives, not
            companies, agencies or businesses. This isn't
            the place or product placement masquering as content.
          </li>
          <li>
            For now, content should be in English. This is simply to make it
            easier to review sites before they're added to this web chain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sites should offer original commentary, analysis or theories of
            film, TV or books. It can be any or all of those art forms, but
            should include at least one as a named category on your site.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Webmasters</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The site's webmaster, whether that's the owner, a writer, developer
            etc, must be able to add a html snippet to their site, as this is how visitors will travel around the chain.
          </li>
<li>Adding
  the widget to your site, and keeping it and your site active, are
  necessary for continued membership of the chain.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Not currently accepting</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sites that <strong>predominantly or only</strong> offer reviews or news
            rather than detailed analysis. (Nothing against these, just that
            there already are ways to discover this kind of content.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Sites that use AI generated, structured or suggested content. The
            sites in this chain should reflect the possibilities of
            <strong>human thought and endeavour</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content mustn't be locked behind paywalls, restrictive cookie
            notices, or anti-adblock tech.
          </li>
        </ul>
