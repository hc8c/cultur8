# About the Fliterati webring
## What is this?
Fliterati is a webring that aims to connect sites that publish written culture commentary (think pieces, opinion, theory, criticism, analysis) of film, TV and literature. You'll find the full details on the website: [https://hc8c.github.io/fliterati/](https://hc8c.github.io/fliterati/).
## For content creators: how to join
Here's a quick overview of the process. For details, incuding critera and rules, see the website linked above.
- Add the webring widget (a html snippet) to your site so it appears on every page - i.e., in a footer or sidebar.
- Add details for your site to sitelist.js in this project repo. The details you add here will be added to the webring navigation, and to the site directory.
- When you make a pull request, I'll quickly confirm you've added the widget and that your site fits the criteria.
- That's all!
## For site visitors: using the webring

## About me
I write and run www.thehaughtyculturist.com. I made this project to connect with other sites in my niche (culture commentary!), and to help keep interesting, human-written content discoverable on a web that's increasingly dominated by product, ad and AI-driven algorithms.
